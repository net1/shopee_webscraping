## Python Automated Shopee Web Scraping Script

This is my web scraping project for gathering data on my University's Senior Research. I used this script to scrape about 700 rows of information with 17 distinct categories.

- It includes scraping:

    - Shop's Characteristics
    
        * Shop Name, Shop Rating Counts, Shop Score, Shop Followers, Shop Product Variation, Shop Response Rate, Shop Response time, Shop Location and Shop Joined Date
  
    - Product's Characteristics
        
        * Product Name, Product Price, Quantity Sold, Product Score, Product Rating Counts, Product Favourite Counts by User and Product Comments
        
    - Link to each product
 
Feel free to check it out !! 
Thank you :D

### Notice
I divided into 3 main parts

Part 3 was coded in a hurry due to the limited amount of time. So, it will have lots of rooms for improvements, but it is functional.
